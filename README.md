•	The rook moves any number of vacant squares forwards, backwards, left, or right in a straight line. 

•	The bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally in a straight line. Consequently, a bishop stays on squares of the same color throughout a game. 

•	The queen moves any number of vacant squares in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, or diagonally, in a straight line.

•	The king moves exactly one vacant square in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, or diagonally.

•	The knight moves on an extended diagonal from one corner of any 2×3 rectangle of squares to the furthest opposite corner. Consequently, the knight alternates its square color each time it moves.

•	The pawn moves forward exactly one space, or optionally, two spaces when on its starting square, toward the opponent's side of the board.
